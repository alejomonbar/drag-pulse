# drag-pulse
Possible tutorial of the drag pulses

## What I updated

- Amplitude calibration for the sx gate (Gaussian pulse) using the Sheldon 2015 approach
- |2> frequency and amplitude calibration
- Classification of states using kmeans

## Next update will include

- Calibrating the DRAG pulse using Sheldon 2015
- See the impact of the DRAG pulse on leakage 
- Impact of different pulse width and the leakage and extra-rotations
- Document every step and organize
